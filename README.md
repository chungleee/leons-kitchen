# Leon's Kitchen
Role based restaurant application (not mobile friendly - yet)

## Description
This app has 3 roles, each role has their own internal app:
  - Admin: custom CMS to create/delete food items, restaurant staffs with roles and view orders.
  - Staff: this part is meant to mimic self-serve kiosks (think McDonalds); Customers can add food items to a cart and create an Food Order after successful payment through Stripe. Newly created Food Orders are sent to the Kitchen instantly
  - Kitchen: Receive Food Orders in real-time (thanks to Pusher). When Food Orders are completed, system sends a text message (thanks to Twilio) to notify the Customer that the order is ready for pick-up.
